# Advent Calendar

App to build an Advent Calendar, provide ratings for each film.\*

## Getting Started

When loading the app for the first time the default empty calendar will be created for you with the 24 days.
The easiest option is to import the default movies using the Import JSON button in the top right corner of the calendar view.
This will populate the calendar with a default set of Christmas movies.
If needed you can reset the calendar to be blank using the reset button in the top right corner of the calendar view.

You can manually add movies to each day by clicking on the day in the calendar view. e.g., 6 for 6th of December.
When looking at a day you can see the following information for each movie: - Movie Title - Service to watch it on - Rating out of 10 - Comments about the movie

#### Note

All data including ratings and comments are stored locally on your device and will not be shared with anyone else.

#### IMPORTANT

If you clear your browser data you will lose all ratings and calendar data.
